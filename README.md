## Description

Deep Learning Project made in python for the recognition of emotion of a person.

Our goal is to obtein a minimum 90% accuracy on emotion recognition from any pictures.
The app need to be able to analyse facial expression dicretly by analysing one image or by analysing frame by frame a video.  
Finding all visbiles faces and give the current emotion of the person base on the six main facial expressions :

- Neutral/Normal
- Sadness
- Happiness
- Fear
- Anger
- Surprise
- Disgust

The app is using the CNN (Convolutional neural network) to analyse the emotion of a person.
It will learn from different databases that contains several images of persons showing one of the six main emotion.
The AI learn from this database by analysing each image, once done our model is able to analyse faces images out of the database.

## Features

- Analyse images/videos and foud every faces.
- Display emotion of a person based on facial expression.

## Report

The report is written in french. No other languages are available.

## Installation

If you just want to start the UI app, then just follow the `1. Python, Tensorflow, Keras` instructions just below.

In the case you want to test the models and train them. I would advised you to follow the `1. Python, Tensorflow, Keras` instructions below and the second set of instructions `2. CUDA and cuDNN installation` that you really need if you don't want the model training to take more than 2 hours. **You still need a Good GPU**
Follow this video steps if you have difficulties <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHWkvEcDBO0&list=LL>.

If you are unable to install CUDA and CuDNN, I would advise you to use a TPU, by using Google Collab.
<https://colab.research.google.com>

### 1. Python, Tensorflow, Keras, OpenCV

To use the program, you need to install python first (version 3.8 advised).
<https://www.python.org>

You can than install the required python packages. They are all listed in the requiremetns.txt file.
To install them all directy, type the following command:

```terminal
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

With all the packages installed you'll be able to start every models but it could take a lot of time. So go to `2. CUDA and cuDNN installation` if you have a good GPU or you want to use Google Collab.

### 2. CUDA and cuDNN installation

Before using the program, you should install CUDA and SDK to allow the program to run with the GPU and not the CPU.
The app is asking a lot of processing, so to speed it we use the GPU instead of the CPU.  

While programming we used different versions of tensorflow, CUDA etc... To know which version of Tensorflow use with you version of CUDA, cudNN etc... check the following website.
